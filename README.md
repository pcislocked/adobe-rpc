# smokes' adoberpc, edited by pcislocked
improvements:

Media encoder support added. It just says "Rendering something." Premiere pro also says "editing something" so i wont leak anything xd

My own api key inserted, so media encoder has a proper icon.

some other stuff as well but i dont remember cuz this files were local for a LONG time.

And, the biggest one.. Mac support, sort of.

# How to use
- install windows onto your computer
- install creative cloud and other software
- crash the premiere pro 21 times
- clone the repo or download zip and extract
- run rpc.py by double clicking it.
optional: add a shortcut to your path folder if you have one so you can just win+r > adoberpc, just like how I use it.
